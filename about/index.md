   I am Chiou Hu, 21 years old, borned in Xiangtan, Hunan Province in China, and now I am living in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, studying in University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(UESTC), and I will graduate in Computer Science from the school as a bachelor in July 2016, and I will study in Nanjing University(NJU) to earn my master's degree.
   Recently I am focusing on data analysis and machine learning, and  finishing my dissertation.
   I devoted most of my undergraduate time in ACM/ICPC, so I have strong algorithm and code capability. I can code in C/C++, Java, and Python, actually I prefer Python, because it has simple syntax but powerful function.
   In my graduate time, I will concentrate on Parallel Computation of Big Data, Data Mining and Analysis, and Machine Learning. And I welcome any communication with me if you want!
   In my daily life, I prefer to play basketball, play computer games including League of Legends(LOL) and Majong etc. And I also like writing and reading.Recently I am reading:
   * 《鸟哥的Linux私房菜》
   * 《大数据导论》
   * 《浪潮之巅》
   * 《天才在左，疯子在右》
   * 《机器学习》
